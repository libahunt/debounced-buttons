//Debounce delay 2 seconds is very long, but lets you observe the meaning of debouncing.
//The press or releasing of the button registers after the state has been stable for 2 seconds.
//If you keep toggling the button during that time, it does not register at all.
//50 ms is a good starting value if you don't know what to put in debounceDelay.

  //USAGE
  //the dbRead function has to be called from inside loop
  //and so often that reading is repeated at least few times before debounceDelay time passes
  
  //myButtonObjectName.dbRead() returns boolean value (1 or 0) of the last state seen stable
  //for the timespan of debounceDelay set for that specific buttonObject
  
  //this statement is a debounced equivalent of 
  //boolean myButtonReading = digitalRead(myButtonPinNumber);
